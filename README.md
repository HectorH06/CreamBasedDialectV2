### General Description

This is an interpreter created with C# based in the simplicity of ASM, BASIC, ALGOL. It's a very simple language and not that usable for complex things.
Since it has only been tested within the VS IDE, and a dedicated IDE has not been developed, it is necessary to have VS installed with C#.
(Sintaxis viewable incode)
